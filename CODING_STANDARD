Erebot uses the same coding standard as the Zend Framework,
with the exception that we use a return carriage between
the end of an 'if' block and the beginning of a following
'else' block.
We use:
  if (...) {
    ...
  }
  else {
    ...
  }

Instead of the following code (required by Zend):
  if (...) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
