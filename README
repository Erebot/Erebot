A modular IRC bot written in PHP

Erebot is an IRC bot written in PHP thought up with modularity in mind.
It already implements a few useful features:
-   connections to IRC servers using either plain-text or crypted connections,
    with support for passworded IRC servers
-   autoconnect and autojoin modules, so you don't need to worry about having
    to make the bot join channels right after connection by yourself
-   a lag checker, which can kill the connection and force the bot to reconnect
    if it's lagging too badly
-   a module that displays information on TV schedules 
-   an implementation of the popular Uno game, compatible with that of rbot,
    but also providing other variants, making the game even funnier
-   an implementation of the TV gameshow Countdown
-   many other modules... plus, it's really easy to roll your own if you want
    to add new features!
