A modular IRC bot written in PHP

Erebot is an IRC bot written in PHP thought up with modularity in mind.
It already implements a few useful features:
-   Connections to IRC servers using either plain-text or encrypted connections,
    with support for passworded IRC servers and "security upgrades".
-   Autoconnect and autojoin modules, so you don't need to worry about having
    to make the bot join channels by yourself.
-   A lag checker, which can kill the connection and force the bot to reconnect
    if it's lagging too badly.
-   A rate-limiting module so you don't have to worry about the bot being
    disconnecting because it is sending too many messages at once.
-   A module that displays information on TV schedules .
-   An implementation of the popular Uno game, compatible with that of rbot,
    but also providing other variants, making the game even funnier.
-   An implementation of the TV gameshow Countdown.
-   An implementation of the traditionnal game "Gang of Four".
-   Many other modules... (more than 20 for now, and counting!)
    Plus, it's really easy to roll your own if you want to add new features!
