Here's a short list of API changes made recently.
Though it's not very long, it was decided to change the API version
because of the way the packaging evolved to (releasing the code as
PEAR packages means we need a new way to organize things -- PEAR
has a few guidelines regarding that which seem quite helpful and
have therefore been adopted).

Main changes:
*   Most class names have changed to accomodate with PEAR2's policy
    regarding the actual class to file mapping.
*   A few methods have been added to somes interfaces or otherwise
    moved from one interface to another.
    It would be vain to try to list them due to the change in class
    names themselves. But expect a more thorough analysis of changes
    for the next API release.
