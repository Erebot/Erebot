Changes in API v0.0.4
---------------------

*   A few methods which expected references have been modified
    to not do so anymore.

*   The Erebot_TextFilter & Erebot_EventTargets classes have
    been merged in a new concept named "event filters" [#271]
    Both event and raw handlers need to be updated.
    When defining an handler, you can pass it a "filter" (an
    object implementing the Erebot_Interface_Event_Match
    interface). Filters have been written which correspond
    to the old text filters & event targets.
    Complex predicates can be defined, using for example
    the Erebot_Event_Match_All & Erebot_Event_Match_Any
    classes (which act like the boolean AND/OR operators).

*   The class Erebot_TextWrapper has been improved and now
    implements some SPL interfaces (Countable, ArrayAccess
    and Iterator) [#342]. This means that you can for example
    retrieve the number of words in the text by using
    count($wrapper).
    The wrapped text is still read-only so operations like
    $wrapper[0] = "Hello"; will throw an exception.

*   As a consequence of the previous point, the following
    methods have been removed:
    -   Erebot_Utils::gettok()
    -   Erebot_Utils::numtok()
    Please use the Erebot_TextWrapper class instead for all
    future developments.

*   Features marked for removal in 0.5.0 have effectively
    been removed (eg. global constants for raw messages).

*   The bot now uses a different raw to detect successful
    connections to IRC servers (and trigger Connect events).
    You may need to update your code if it relied on events
    being received in a precise order upon connection.

*   The new Erebot_Identity class has been written in order
    to simplify extraction of information from IRC masks.
    It provides more features than Erebot_Utils::extractNick()
    and is therefore preferred. It is now used internally,
    especially for events whose source or target are masks.
    As a result, Erebot_Utils::extractNick() was removed.
