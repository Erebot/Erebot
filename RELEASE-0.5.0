Erebot v0.5.0
-------------

Major changes:
*   Change timers so that additional arguments can be passed to callbacks.
*   The bot now traps the SIGHUP signal and tries to reload its configuration
    when such a signal is received. This feature is still very experimental
    and will probably evolve in the next releases [#89 & #301]
*   Erebot_TextFilter & Erebot_EventTargets have been merged together
    in a new concept named "event filters" [#271]
*   Miscellaneous improvements have been made to the Erebot_TextWrapper
    class [#342].
*   Support for proxies has been added, the bot can now connect to IRC
    servers using an HTTP or SOCKS (version 5) proxy. Proxies can also
    be chained in case you must pass several of them to get out of your
    LAN [#333].
*   A module called "CtcpResponder" has been added to respond to CTCP
    requests [#323].
*   A mechanism has been added to prevent the bot from flooding the server.
    To that effect, a new module called "RateLimiter" has been added which
    implements a basic bandwidth throttling algorithm [#276].
*   The "NickTracker" module has been renamed into "IrcTracker".
    It also tracks changes related to IRC channels now [#73].
*   The Gang of Four module has been adapted for the new architecture [#71].
*   The Uno module has been updated as well [#70].
*   Some features marked as deprecated have been removed.
