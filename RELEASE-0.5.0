Erebot v0.5.0
-------------

Major changes:
*   Change timers so that additional arguments can be passed to callbacks.
*   The bot now traps the SIGHUP signal and tries to reload its configuration
    when such a signal is received. This feature is still very experimental
    and will probably evolve in the next releases [#89 & #301]
*   The Erebot_TextFilter & Erebot_EventTargets classes have been merged
    in a new concept named "event filters" [#271]
*   Miscellaneous improvements have been made to the Erebot_TextWrapper
    class [#342].
*   Some features marked as deprecated have been removed.
