Contribute
==========

So, you took interest in Erebot and would like to contribute back?
This is the right page!

There are actually several ways by which would may contribute
to the project:

*   by `reporting new issues`_ (or asking for new features)
*   by forking the code and `sending pull requests`_
*   by running the tests suite (either manually or by
    `providing a test machine`_ [#]_)
*   by `joining our IRC channel`_

If you plan on sending patches (or pull requests), please read our
documentation on the `coding standard`_ used by Erebot developers first.

..  [#] Such a machine is usually called a "buildslave" as it will
    run miscellaneous tasks each time a new version of the code is
    released (eg. build the HTML documentation, build PEAR packages,
    run the test suites, etc.).
