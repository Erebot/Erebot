Contribute
==========

So, you took interest in Erebot and would like to contribute back?
This is the right page!

There are several ways by which you may contribute to the project.


Try it!
-------

The more people use it, the better, because it means bugs and regressions
can be detected more quickly.


Report Bugs / Suggest Features
------------------------------

If you use Erebot and find issues with it, please let us know on `GitHub
<https://github.com/Erebot/Erebot/issues/new>`_.
Try to provide as much detail as possible on how to reproduce your issue.
As a rule of thumb, the easier it is to reproduce an issue,
the quicker it gets fixed.


Improve the Documentation
-------------------------

The documentation for the project is stored alongside the code, in the
:file:`docs/src/` folder. We use the `Sphinx`_ documentation builder and
the `Read The Docs`_ platform to produce the documentation in a variety
of output formats.

We try to document Erebot as much as we can, but acting both as developers
and documentation writers, we tend to be biased as to what needs documentation.

So if you feel like some parts could be clearer, send us a pull request
with your modifications and we'll try to review them as soon as possible.
Any help to improve the documentation will be greatly appreciated!


..  _`new modules`:

New modules
-----------

If you wish to contribute new modules, you should probably start by reading
our development guide on :doc:`/Developers/New_module`.
Once your code is ready, make sure to send an email to erebot@erebot.net
with a link to it so that your module can be added to our list of
:ref:`Third-party modules`.


Pull requests
-------------

If you plan on sending us pull requests, please read our documentation on
Erebot's :doc:`/Developers/Coding_Standard` first.
Your patch will have a greater chance of being merged if it already abides
by that standard when you submit it.

To contribute a patch, you will need a GitHub account. Then you can simply:

-   `Fork the code <https://github.com/Erebot/Erebot/fork>`__ to your own account.
-   Create a new branch.
-   Hack away as much as you want.
-   Create a pull request with your changes.

Once your pull request has been received, it will undergo a review process
to decide whether it can be accepted as-is, or if it needs some tweaking
before being merged.


Translations
------------

The project uses the `Transifex service <https://www.transifex.net/>`__
to manage translations.
All submissions or patches to translations must be submitted through
`Erebot's project page on Transifex <https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/Erebot/>`_.

To submit a new translation or a patch for an already existing translation,
you will need a Transifex account. Then, apply for one of the translation teams
or request the creation of a new team in case none currently exists for your
language. As soon as you have joined one of the translation teams, you may
proceed with your changes.

Just like for the code, translations undergo manual review. Once a translation
has been formally reviewed, it will eventually be merged in the project
alongside other translations.


Join the community
------------------

If you would like to chat with the developers and other users of Erebot,
feel free to join `our IRC channel <irc://irc.iiens.net/Erebot>`_.
This channel can also be used to discuss issues, new ideas / feature requests
and to follow the bot's development.
