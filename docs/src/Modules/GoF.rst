Example
-------

Here, we enable the Gang of Four module at the general configuration level.
Therefore, the game will be available on all networks/servers/channels.
Of course, you can use a more restrictive configuration file if it suits
your needs better.

..  parsed-code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <configuration
      xmlns="http://localhost/Erebot/"
      version="0.20"
      language="fr-FR"
      timezone="Europe/Paris">

      <modules>
        <!-- Other modules ignored for clarity. -->

        <!--
          Configure the module:
          - the game will be started using the "!gangof4" command.
          - the game will start 2 minutes (120 seconds) after 3 players
            join it (to give time for a fourth player to join the game).
        -->
        <module name="\\Erebot\\Module\\GoF">
          <param name="trigger_create" value="gangof4" />
          <param name="start_delay"    value="120" />
        </module>
      </modules>
    </configuration>



Usage
=====

This section assumes default values are used for all triggers.
Please refer to :ref:`configuration options <configuration options>`

Also, knowledge of the rules for the Gang of Four game is assumed.
The full rules for the game can be found (in multiple languages) on
