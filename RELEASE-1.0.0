Erebot v1.0.0
-------------

Major changes:
*   The timers are now compatible with Windows once again. The previous trick
    we used was broken somewhere between PHP 5.3.3 and 5.3.9.
*   Erebot can now be run from a PHAR archive (see installation instructions
    for more information). The same is also true for the default modules.
*   Fixed an error when connecting to an IPv6 server on an uncommon port.
*   Fixed a bug whereby SSL connections would receive all but the last line
    in the connection's buffer, resulting in frequent timeouts.
*   Added Erebot_Callable to deal with PHP's "callables" in a forward-compatible
    way (works with functions, [static] methods, lambdas, closures & objects
    implementing the __invoke() method).
*   Added full support for CTCP quoting, according to the specs at
    http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html
*   Refactored the way numerics are handled, by defining specific profiles
    for every supported IRCd + generic ones for RFCs.
*   Added a new class Erebot_IrcParser to deal with IRC messages (GH #10).
    This class implements proper parsing where the old class would sometimes
    use shortcuts that would make it incompatible with certain IRCds.
*   Changed the way we deal with I/Os. This affects the Erebot_IrcConnection
    class as well as other classes that must do I/O manipulation.
*   Refactored the styling API (GH #21).
*   Added support for simple computations in styling templates (GH #23).
*   Better handling of I18N and locales.
*   Better handling of IRC collations (GH #25, #1).
*   Experimental workaround for Pyrus' incorrect handling of the data, doc,
    www & test roles.
*   Better integration with tracis-ci.org for Continuous Integration
    (in addition to the one already in place at http://buildbot.erebot.net/).
*   Integration with the Transifex translation project.
*   Upgraded Plop to version 1.0.0-dev for logging purposes.
